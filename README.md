           **ChasePay: Online Bank Application**
 
**Overview:**

The goal of this project is to develop a secure and reliable online bank application using Node.js that can be hosted on Vercel. The application will include features for credit and debit transactions, SMTP for email notifications, user and admin dashboards, as well as an OTP (One-Time Password) system for secure withdrawals. The OTP system will allow admins to assign specific OTP codes (OTP1, OTP2, OTP3) to user accounts for withdrawal verification.

**Features**

**1) User Authentication:**

Users can sign up, sign in, and reset their passwords securely.
Implement authentication middleware to protect sensitive routes.

**2) Account Management:**
Users can view their account details, including balance and transaction history.
Ability to update user profile information.

**3) Credit and Debit Transactions:**
Users can perform credit and debit transactions securely.
Implement validation to ensure sufficient funds for debit transactions.

**4) SMTP Integration:**
Email notifications for various actions performed on the site (e.g., transaction confirmation, password reset).
Integration with SMTP service (e.g., SendGrid) for sending emails.

**5) User Dashboard:**
User-friendly dashboard displaying transaction history, account summary, and other relevant information.
Filter and search functionalities for transaction history.

**6) Admin Dashboard:**
Admins can monitor transaction records and user activities.
Functionality to update user accounts, deposit funds, and disable user accounts if necessary.
Transaction approval, decline, or placing transactions on pending status.

**7) OTP System for Withdrawals:**
Admins can generate and assign OTP codes (OTP1, OTP2, OTP3) to user accounts.
Users are required to input assigned OTP code during withdrawal requests.
Admins can approve, decline, or put transactions on pending status based on OTP verification.

**8) Technical Specifications:**

**Frontend:**
Utilize modern frontend frameworks like React.js for building user interfaces.
Implement responsive design for compatibility across various devices.

**Backend:**
Develop backend APIs using Node.js and Express.js for handling user authentication, transactions, and admin functionalities.
Utilize JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.

**Database:**
Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing user data, transactions, and OTP codes.
Implement database schema to maintain data integrity.

**SMTP Service:**
Integrate with a reliable SMTP service provider for sending transactional emails.
Ensure secure configuration and handling of email credentials.

**Security:**
Implement best practices for security, including data encryption, input validation, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
Use HTTPS protocol for secure communication between client and server.

**Deployment:**
Host the application on Vercel for scalability and reliability.
Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and continuous integration.

**Additional Considerations:**

**Error Handling:**
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to users.

**Logging:**
Utilize logging libraries to log application events and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

**Testing:**
Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
Utilize testing frameworks like Jest for backend testing and React Testing Library for frontend testing.

**Documentation:**
Provide comprehensive documentation for developers, including API documentation, installation instructions, and deployment guidelines.

**Compliance:**
Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) for handling user data and financial transactions.

**Scalability:**
Design the application architecture to be scalable to handle a large number of users and transactions efficiently.
