            Enrollment in Zelle® with a U.S. checking or savings account is required to use the service. Chasepay customers must use an eligible Chasepay consumer or business checking account, which may have its own account fees. Consult your account agreement. To send money to or receive money from a small business, both parties must be enrolled with Zelle® directly through their financial institution's online or mobile app experience. Funds are typically made available in minutes when the recipient's email address or U.S. mobile number is already enrolled with Zelle® (go to <a href="">enroll.zellepay.com</a> to view participating banks). Select transactions could take up to 3 business days. Enroll on the Chase Mobile® app or Chase Online&#84880;. Limitations may apply. Message and data rates may apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only send money to people and businesses you trust. Neither Chasepay nor Zelle® offers a protection program for any authorized payments made with Zelle®, or provide coverage for non-received, damaged, or not-as-described goods and services you purchase using Zelle®, so you might not be able to get your money back once you send it.

            With Chasepay Overdraft AssistSM, we won't charge an Overdraft Fee if you're overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the business day <b>OR</b> if you're overdrawn by more than $50 and you bring your account balance to overdrawn by $50 or less at the end of the next business day (you have until 11PM ET (8 PM PT) to make a deposit or transfer). Chasepay Overdraft Assist does not require enrollment and comes with eligible Chasepay checking accounts.

            We will decline or return transactions when you do not have enough money in your account to cover the charge. However, you could still end up with a negative balance if, for example, a transaction is approved for one amount, but then the actual charge is more than what you have in your account (like when you add a tip at a restaurant after the transaction for the meal was already approved). Even if you have a negative balance, we will not charge you an overdraft fee.

            <b>For Chasepay Secure Checking&#8480; only:</b> Early direct deposit is a service that comes with your Chasepay Secure Checking account in which we credit your eligible direct deposit transaction up to two business days early. You must set up direct deposit to your account. The timing of when these transactions will be credited is based on when the payer submits the information to us. This means when these transactions are credited could vary and you may not receive your funds early. Eligible transactions are certain ACH credit transactions such as payroll, government benefits or similar transactions.
